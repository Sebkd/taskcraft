//! # taskcraft
//!
//! Background task queue for Rust on the tokio runtime.
//!
//! **Work in progress.** This version contains the task model only: the task,
//! its states, metadata and the answers a queue gives about tasks. Workers,
//! sources and queues follow in later versions; the first working release
//! will be `0.1.0`.
//!
//! The target behaviour is specified in
//! [`openspec/specs/taskcraft/taskcraft.md`](https://github.com/Sebkd/taskcraft/blob/master/openspec/specs/taskcraft/taskcraft.md).
//!
//! ## Terms
//!
//! - **Task** ([`Task`]) — one unit of work: an id unique within its queue
//!   ([`TaskId`]), typed arguments, metadata and attempt counters.
//! - **Metadata** ([`Metadata`]) — values that accompany a task, keyed by
//!   their type: trace context, priority, details about the recipient.
//!   Arguments say what to do; metadata says what else is known.
//! - **Metadata registry** ([`MetadataRegistry`]) — stable names for metadata
//!   types, needed only when tasks are stored outside the process.
//! - **State** ([`TaskState`]) — where a task is in its lifecycle. Only the
//!   transitions of the lifecycle table are possible ([`Lifecycle`]).
//! - **Terminal state** — succeeded, failed, panicked or cancelled; nothing
//!   follows it.
//! - **Ack point** ([`AckPoint`]) — when the source is told a task is taken:
//!   on accept or on completion.
//! - **Push outcome** ([`PushOutcome`]) — the answer to a push: enqueued,
//!   already running, already finished, or rejected.
//! - **Status** ([`TaskStatus`]) and **finish reason** ([`FinishReason`]) —
//!   what a status request reports.
